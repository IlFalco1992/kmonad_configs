# Kmonad config matching my QMK mods
There are home row mods and 3 layers. The home row mods leave the `A` key free so that on Mac I can hold it to access the accented versions. 	`F` and `J` are shift if held, `D` and `K` are ctrl if held, `S` and `L` are cmd (or the win key) if held, `;` is alt if held.  
The second layer is mainly used to access the arrow keys in vim style (hjkl) and it is accessed by holding the spacebar. On this layer `P` is mapped to backspace, `;` to enter, `Q` to escape, `W` to \`, `E` to ~, `R` to tab, `T` to backtab, `O` to \ and `I` to |. `ASDF` are also mapped to their respective mods.  
The third and last layer is accessed by tapping `Z` while in the second layer, if tapped again you go back to the second layer, when spacebar is released on any of the layers you go back to the base QWERTY layer. This layer is used for numbers and symbols, the top row is mapped to the numbers 1 to 0 (`Q` to `P`) and the second row is mapped to the symbols associated with the numbers above (`A` to `;`).
